# cmpt225_Assignment2
School assignment for CMPT225

Code in LinkedStack.h and LinkedList.h was written based off code provided by CMPT 225; thank you to the TAs who wrote that code.

Settings and config for VS code are included.

The makefile is currently configured for Linux -- the target executable name should be changed to end in ".exe" for MinGW on Windows.
